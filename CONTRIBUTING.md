3. **Check different browsers** - Test in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
4. **Test on different devices** - Mobile, tablet, desktop
5. **Look for performance issues** - Slow loading, memory leaks, etc.
6. **Check error handling** - What happens when things go wrong?

**When you find a bug:**
- **Report it** in an issue (even if you can't fix it)
- **Fix it yourself** if you can - create a PR!
- **Document the steps** to reproduce it
- **Test your fix** thoroughly

**Every bug fix makes CollabSpace more competitive with Google Docs!** üèÜ
